# Fuji-Web with a human in the loop ðŸ—»

This is a fork from Normal Computing's (Fuji Web)[https://github.com/normal-computing/fuji-web] with added human-in-the-loop functionality.

The user can configure 'Safety Checkpoint' rules in settings. Fuji will ask user for permission when its planned action triggers a checkpoint.

(Sorry for the weird artifacts. My screen recorder does not play nice with Fuji, apparently.)
